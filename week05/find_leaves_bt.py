class Solution:
    # TC: O(HN), H = Height of the binary tree, N = number of nodes.
    # In the first level we are traversing thorugh N nodes. In the
    # second level we will traverse through (N - N/2)nodes, and so on
    # and so forth. Hence, here the time complexity will be O(N)

    # As just mentioned, in each height level we are traversing thorugh roughly N nodes. If height
    # of the tree is balanced then the total time complexity will be O(Nlogn),
    # if the tree is skewed to one side, the time complexity will be O(NË†2)

    # SC: O(N + N), N = Number of nodes.
    # Because we are ultimately returning all the nodes, that will be responsible
    # for O(N) time complexity.
    # Also recursion stack will also be responsible for O(N) in the worst
    # case(when the tree is skewed).
    # So the total time complexity will be O(N + N) -> O(N)
